    <p>
      I believe the best way to learn something is to write it down, visualize
      it, and then explain it to other people. That is why I start
      DiveinDataScience to keep all of my knowledge in neat so that we can learn
      and share with each other. ​ This blog contains most of work and projects
      that I involved in including Uni projects, side projects from competitions
      and my personal project. To see what I’ve been up to, browse my site,
      learn about my passions, and explore what excites and interests you as
      well.
